# Ragchatbot_for_Pharmaceutical
This project, titled "Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Chatbot for Pharmaceutical Purposes," focuses on developing an AI-powered chatbot designed to efficiently and accurately answer queries based on the content of pharmaceutical brochures. Utilizing the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, the chatbot combines the semantic understanding of Sentence-Transformers and the scalable vector retrieval capabilities of ChromaDB to provide contextually relevant responses. This system addresses the need for quick and precise information retrieval in the pharmaceutical industry. Future enhancements include expanding the dataset with diverse medical resources, optimizing the model with advanced techniques such as quantization, distillation, and pruning, and improving user query handling and personalization by incorporating user medical history.
